The creation of this photomanipulation was heavily influenced by one of my favorite bands - Muse. Most of the elements used come from their album covers, bringing them together to form this fictional poster.

I decided to place certain elements of a few album covers to create a story while also sticking to the given topic. My intention was to represent ourselves as the man walking down the road and the people that care about us disguised as the hands pulling the strings - giving their best to stir us on the right path even in dark times.
