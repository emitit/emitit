__ABOUT THE PROJECT__

This is an ongoing project that consists of all of my social media, branding and packaging work at Natura Therapy. __NATURA THERAPY__ is a leading company on the Balkan market that develops, manufactures and sells natural food supplements designed to improve and maintain human health. They have developed multiple brands, each focusing on a different aspect of a human's health. 

__MY ROLE__

Since the company has so many brands under it, all of them have a different target audience that requires a different approach. As the designer on Natura Therapy's marketing team, my responsibility is to make unique, eye-catching social media designs that capture the attention of each audience, as well as captivating packages for their products.

__PACKAGING/LABEL DESIGN__
This role also involved creating label designs for upcoming products. My role was to come up with a suitable design for each product - ranging from supplements to body creams, read on to find out what each one is all about!

    R&R MELEM
    Meaning Renew & Repair is a healing balm designed to treat conditions like eczema, psoriasis or dermatitis. The idea behind the label and box design was to create something that will resemble a on oil-based natural product, given a yellow primary color because of the balm's light yellow color. As this is a product that has recently rolled out, I also created promotional materials to showcase the benefits of the procut, as well as all the natural ingredients it was made of.
