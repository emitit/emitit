__ABOUT THE PROJECT__

This is an ongoing project that consists of all of my social media, branding and packaging work at Natura Therapy. __NATURA THERAPY__ is a leading company on the Balkan market that develops, manufactures and sells natural food supplements designed to improve and maintain human health. They have developed multiple brands, each focusing on a different aspect of a human's health. 

__MY ROLE__

Since the company has so many brands under it, all of them have a different target audience that requires a different approach. As the designer on Natura Therapy's marketing team, my responsibility is to make unique, eye-catching social media designs that capture the attention of each audience, as well as captivating packages for their products.
