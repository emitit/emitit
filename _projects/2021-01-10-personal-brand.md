__CAPTURING YOUR ESSENCE THROUGH YOUR BRAND__

A strong, bold personal brand is the key to stand out in any field. While the visual aspect is one piece of the puzzle, it plays a very big role in accurately portraying your authentic personality and style, especially as a designer.

This is how I defined my personal brand.

__PROCESS__

My main goal was to create a simple and clean yet modern logo that's easily recognizable. I took the approach of taking my initials and morphing them into a "one line" illustration, combining it with playful colors to capture the full brand.
