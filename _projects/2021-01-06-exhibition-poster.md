For the 2022 Student Exhibition at the Graphic Design Bootcamp I attended, each one of us was given the task to design a poster and an invitation.

The design I created ended up being chosen as the official poster for the exhibition scheduled for October 2022.

<strong>THE IDEA BEHIND THE POSTER</strong>

During this entire year at the academy, we expanded our skills, ideas, our knowledge and we pushed our boundaries, therefore to me, this was the perfect way to capture that growth.

The main subject of the poster is Seymour Chwast, a designer known for his enormous
contributions towards todayâ€™s graphic design - along with flowers coming out of his head,
intending to also resemble the growth and expansion - both personal and professional.
