__ABOUT THE PROJECT__

I was presented with a challenge by a client to design two separate booking engines with this goal specifically aiming to offer lower prices for hotels around to world and make accomodation booking easier. 


__WHY TWO DIFFERENT WEBSITES?__

Travelling covers an enormous group of people, so the client wanted to pursue two completely different options that would allow a different group of users to optimize their booking experience. 

The goal for Vacay Hooray was a modern, fun approach that would stand out of in the ocean of booking engines that already exist. This business distinguishes itself by negotiating exclusive, unpublished hotel rates daily, and the challenge was to design a booking experience that effectively communicates this value while ensuring a seamless search and reservation process.

I created a separate case study for the second project, take a look at it here!

__MY ROLE__

As the UX/UI Designer for this project, my job was to turn the client's idea into a booking platform thatâ€™s both user-friendly and visually appealing. From start to finish, I was deeply involved in the design process, including:

<li> Conducting competitive research to get a clear picture of the widely-used booking engines.</li>
<li> Discovering user pain points throug reviews and articles and identifying areas for improvement in existing platforms.</li>
<li> Creating high-fidelity wireframes that addressed both what users need and what the client envisioned.</li>
<li> Creating a design system/guide consisting of interactive elements, colors and typography to make the design process smoother and simplify handoff.</li>
<li> Iterating on designs based on feedback as well as time & budget constraints.</li>
<li> Making sure the design could handle new features (ex. reviews) </li>
