__ABOUT THE PROJECT__

This is an ongoing project that consists of all of my social media, branding and packaging work at Natura Therapy. __NATURA THERAPY__ is a leading company on the Balkan market that develops, manufactures and sells natural food supplements designed to improve and maintain human health. They have developed multiple brands, each focusing on a different aspect of a human's health. 

__MY ROLE__

I joined Natura Therapy as a Graphic Designer to work on improving the overall visual identity. As the brand is growing, I have also taken upon creating marketing materials for other countries where the company sells its products. Since the company has so many brands under it, all of them have a different target audience that requires a different approach.

I create materials for three individual brands under Natura Therapy created for different purposes (skincare, health and bodybuilding).

As of May, we also have one more designer on the team who I'm actively training.
